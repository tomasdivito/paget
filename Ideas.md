### New ideas to implement in the project

- Make the `Portfolio` `About` and `Contact` Sections one page, `Gallery` with a selector for the current
component to watch.
- When you click on one of the links in `Landing` you will move to the `Gallery` (Gallery will be the
section that contains the Portfolio, About and Contact components) and will change the current selection
of the gallery.

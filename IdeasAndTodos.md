### New ideas to implement in the project

- [x] Make the `Portfolio` `About` and `Contact` Sections one page, `Gallery` with a selector for the current
component to watch.
- [x] When you click on one of the links in `Landing` you will move to the `Gallery` (Gallery will be the
section that contains the Portfolio, About and Contact components) and will change the current selection
of the gallery.

- I implemented the `Gallery`, so now I should fix the styling issues to make the pages look better on the `Gallery` section and style the buttons to change the `current_page`
